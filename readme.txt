This addon will scrape event/fight data for your local files from sherdog.com and allow to browse/search by various categories. sherdog.com's fight finder is the defacto standard source for MMA results and records and has listings for almost every pro fight ever sanctioned.

[B]If you have a lot of events it takes a LONG time to populate the database on the first run.[/B]

To have the addon locate and identify an event you must place a file named "sherdogEventID" or "sherdogEventID.nfo" in the event's root folder which contains only the event's ID (on it's own on 1 line) from sherdog.com.

e.g. For UFC 92 the ID is 8732 which is found at the end of the event's URL: http://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-92-The-Ultimate-2008-8732

You must first set the location of your MMA video folder in addon settings before the script will run.

I'd also really appreciate if anyone would like to contribute with some posters/logos for MMA promotions which I can display in the plugin (I'll keep a list of ones i already have below so that noone wastes any time).
